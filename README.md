Withdrawal-and-Normal-Calculator-Application

The react js application "Withdrawal-and-Normal-Calculator-Application" is in its early stages of development and is not yet ready for release. I am still working on the application, but the app will include a calculator. I plan for this to be an app that will help my mom, who has trouble remembering certain things, keep track of her withdrawals from the bank. Once I get the Withdrawal and Normal Calculator app ready, it will be easy to add more features to it.
